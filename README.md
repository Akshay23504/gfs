# GFS

This is the implementation of Google File System (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf)

It has been developed using Play Framework.

Only some of the features described in the paper have been implemented.

There is also a neat UI (master dashboard) to start/stop chunkservers, to display chunks etc.

The GFS client needs to take care of features as described in the paper and is not part of this project.
